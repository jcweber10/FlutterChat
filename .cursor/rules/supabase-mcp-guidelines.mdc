Scope:
This rule applies specifically to actions involving the Supabase MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools—such as creating projects, running migrations, modifying Supabase resources, or executing SQL.
Rule:
Whenever you are about to perform a Supabase MCP action, you will:
Clearly explain what you are going to do and why.
Ask to execute the plan.
Only proceed with the Supabase MCP action after you confirm.
Example:
“I am about to create a new Supabase project in your organization for development purposes. This will incur costs as per your plan. Do you want to execute this plan?”
Summary:
You will always explain and request confirmation before executing any Supabase MCP actions.
